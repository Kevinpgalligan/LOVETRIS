### Description
An AI to play this Tetris variant: https://qntm.org/files/hatetris/hatetris.html

### TODO
1. ~~Core data structures (board, pieces, piece orientations, piece moves)~~
2. Algorithm to find valid positions of a piece.
3. Hatetris AI: look at all possible moves for all possible pieces, pick the one the maximises the minimum possible height. Tie breaks resolved by order of pieces. I think. Need to review the HATETRIS code.
4. Some sort of interface for testing it and playing with it.
5. Greedy search (algorithm and heuristics).
6. Rework genetic algo code to find best heuristic weights.
7. Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search.
