Information from profiling...


#### Attempt the first

The command I ran:

LOVETRIS> (time
           (flamegraph:save-flame-graph ("~/proyectos/profiling/search.stack")
             (run-searcher (lambda (state) (make-instance 'beam-searcher
                                                          :disable-beam t
                                                          :search-depth 4
                                                          :heuristic-eval (get-heuristic-eval -0.1 1.0 -0.4 -0.4)
                                                          :start-state state))
                           5)))



Output:

  165.556 seconds of real time
  166.057226 seconds of total run time (163.555059 user, 2.502167 system)

#### Attempt the second
Changed get-worst-piece to return the placements that it computed, just so that the effort doesn't have to be repeated. This seems to have had a disproportionate effect on the performance; either that, or the testing environment has changed since the first time. I expected it to reduce the time by about 1/8, since there are 7 pieces and possible-next-states used to recompute the placements for 1 of them (the worst piece).
